# Skills Feature MVA Gap Analysis Report

## 📋 Overview
This report compares the current state of the Skills feature (as described in `MVA-REALIGNMENT-PLAN.md` and the folder structure) to the standard MVA Refactor Template. It highlights what is complete, partially complete, and what is missing or needs improvement, with actionable recommendations.

---

## ✅ What Is Complete

### Directory Structure
- [x] `model/` (was `models/`): Pure data structures and business logic
- [x] `adapters/`: Data transformation and hooks
- [x] `utils/`: Utility functions
- [x] `types.ts`: Centralized type definitions
- [x] `index.ts`: Main feature exports

### MVA Planning
- [x] `MVA-REALIGNMENT-PLAN.md` exists and is detailed
- [x] Phased migration plan is documented
- [x] Benefits, risks, and timeline are considered

### Adapter Layer
- [x] Adapters are present (e.g., `useSkillData`, `useSkillState`, `useSkillFilters`, `useSkillComputed`)
- [x] Adapters are hook-based and React-idiomatic

### Model Layer
- [x] Pure data structures and data providers exist
- [x] Utilities for data manipulation are present

### Testing
- [x] Good test coverage (87 tests as noted)

---

## 🟡 What Is Partially Complete

### Component Architecture
- [~] `components/atomic/` and `components/composition/` exist, but:
  - Some atomic components may still contain logic or state
  - Not all presentational components are fully extracted (e.g., SkillBadge, SkillPerkCountBadge)
- [~] `components/view/` exists, but some high-level view logic may still be in pages or legacy views
- [~] Some composition components may still mix logic and presentation

### View Layer
- [~] `views/` directory exists, but should be merged into `components/view/` for consistency
- [~] Entry points in `pages/` are present, but may still contain logic that belongs in adapters or views

### Data Flow
- [~] Data flow is mostly Model → Adapter → View, but check for any direct data access in views or composition components
- [~] Some state may still be scattered (e.g., filter state, selection state)

### Documentation
- [~] Good planning documentation, but may lack up-to-date diagrams or mapping tables for current vs. target state

---

## ❌ What Is Missing or Needs Improvement

### Atomic/Composition/View Separation
- [ ] Ensure all atomic components are pure and stateless (no hooks, no business logic)
- [ ] Move any remaining logic from atomic/composition components into adapters
- [ ] Ensure all high-level view components are in `components/view/` and only consume adapters
- [ ] Remove any legacy or duplicate components from `views/` and `pages/`

### Adapter Specialization
- [ ] Ensure there is a dedicated adapter for each view type (e.g., QuickSelector, Reference, Detail)
- [ ] Remove any remaining "unified" or catch-all adapters
- [ ] Ensure all state management is in adapters, not in views or composition components

### Data Flow & State Management
- [ ] Audit for any direct data access in views or composition components
- [ ] Ensure all state (filters, selection, etc.) is managed in adapters
- [ ] Remove any duplicate or legacy state management

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Add/expand unit tests for new adapters and atomic components
- [ ] Add integration tests for view-adapter interactions
- [ ] Add E2E tests for user workflows (if not already present)

### Documentation
- [ ] Add/update diagrams showing data flow and component hierarchy
- [ ] Add mapping tables: current components → MVA roles
- [ ] Document any remaining migration steps and TODOs

## 📊 Summary Table

| Area                | Status      | Notes/Action Items |
|---------------------|------------|-------------------|
| Directory Structure | ✅ Complete | Rename `models/` → `model/` done |
| Model Layer         | ✅ Complete | Pure data/utilities present |
| Adapter Layer       | ✅ Complete | Hook-based, specialized |
| Atomic Components   | 🟡 Partial  | Ensure all are pure, stateless |
| Composition         | 🟡 Partial  | Remove logic, use only atomics/adapters |
| View Components     | 🟡 Partial  | Move all to `components/view/` |
| Data Flow           | 🟡 Partial  | Audit for direct data access |
| State Management    | 🟡 Partial  | All state in adapters |
| Testing             | 🟡 Partial  | Add more integration/E2E tests |
| Documentation       | 🟡 Partial  | Add diagrams, mapping tables |

## 📝 Actionable Recommendations

1. **Audit Atomic Components**: Ensure all are pure, stateless, and presentational only.
2. **Move All View Components**: Consolidate all high-level view components into `components/view/`.
3. **Remove Legacy/Unified Adapters**: Ensure all adapters are specialized and hook-based.
4. **Audit Data Flow**: Check for any direct data/model access in views or composition components.
5. **Centralize State**: Move all state management to adapters.
6. **Update Documentation**: Add up-to-date diagrams and mapping tables.
7. **Expand Testing**: Add integration and E2E tests for new MVA structure.
8. **Cleanup**: Remove any deprecated, duplicate, or legacy files.

## 📅 Next Steps

- [ ] Complete atomic/composition/view separation
- [ ] Finalize adapter specialization
- [ ] Audit and centralize all state management
- [ ] Update documentation and diagrams
- [ ] Expand and update tests
- [ ] Remove all legacy code
