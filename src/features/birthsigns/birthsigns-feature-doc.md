# Birthsigns Feature Documentation

## üìã General Rule for Feature Documentation

All features in the Lorerim Arcaneum project must follow this standardized documentation structure. This ensures consistency, maintainability, and comprehensive coverage of feature functionality, architecture, and implementation details.

---

## üéØ Feature Overview

### Purpose
The Birthsigns feature provides a comprehensive interface for browsing and selecting character birthsigns in the Lorerim Arcaneum application. It delivers a searchable, filterable, and accordion-based experience for birthsign selection, enabling players to explore celestial constellations and their associated magical effects, abilities, and character bonuses through an intuitive accordion interface.

### Core Functionality
- **Birthsign Browsing**: Display all available birthsigns in accordion grid/list view modes with visual constellation indicators
- **Advanced Search**: Multi-category autocomplete search by constellation types, effect categories, and tags
- **Detailed Information**: Comprehensive birthsign details including abilities, effects, requirements, and lore
- **Filtering**: Tag-based filtering system for constellation types, effect categories, and tags
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with adaptive layouts
- **Markdown Support**: Rich text rendering with support for bold formatting, lists, and emphasis
- **Display Controls**: Toggle visibility of stats, powers, skills, and effects sections

### Data Structure
Birthsigns are defined with the following structure:

```typescript
interface Birthsign {
  id: string
  name: string
  constellation: string
  description: string
  lore: string
  abilities: BirthsignAbility[]
  requirements: string[]
  tags: string[]
  levelRequirement?: number
  globalFormId?: string
}

interface BirthsignAbility {
  name: string
  description: string
  effectType: 'passive' | 'active' | 'conditional'
  magnitude: number
  duration?: number
  cooldown?: number
  requirements?: string[]

## üîß Technical Design

### Data Flow Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[birthsigns.json] --> B[AccordionBirthsignsPage]
    B --> C[useBirthsignData Hook]
    C --> D[useBirthsignFilters Hook]
    D --> E[Filtered Results]
    E --> F[BirthsignAccordion/BirthsignCard]

    H --> I[FuzzySearchBox]
    I --> J[Filter Logic]
    J --> K[Filtered Results]
    K --> F
```

### State Management

The feature uses a combination of custom hooks for state management:

1. **useBirthsignData** (`hooks/useBirthsignData.ts`):
   - `birthsigns`: Raw birthsign data from JSON
   - `loading`: Data fetching state
   - `error`: Error handling state
   - `refetch`: Function to reload data

2. **useBirthsignFilters** (`hooks/useBirthsignFilters.ts`):
   - `selectedTags`: Active search and filter tags
   - `sortBy`: Current sorting option
   - `viewMode`: Grid or list view preference
   - `expandedBirthsigns`: Set of expanded accordion items
   - `filteredBirthsigns`: Computed filtered results
   - `displayItems`: Items to display based on filters

3. **useDisplayControls** (`hooks/useDisplayControls.ts`):
   - `showStats`: Stats section visibility
   - `showPowers`: Powers section visibility
   - `showSkills`: Skills section visibility
   - `showEffects`: Effects section visibility

### Data Transformation

The feature transforms birthsign data for display and filtering:

**Source Format** (`Birthsign`):
```typescript
{
  id: "warrior",
  name: "The Warrior",
  constellation: "Warrior",
  description: "The Warrior grants increased combat abilities...",
  abilities: [...],
  requirements: [...],
  tags: ["Combat", "Strength"]
}
```

**Display Format** (Processed for UI):
```typescript
{
  id: "warrior",
  name: "The Warrior",
  constellation: "Warrior",
  description: "The Warrior grants increased combat abilities...",
  tags: ["Combat", "Strength"],
  searchCategories: ["Warrior", "Combat", "Strength"],
  formattedText: "Enhanced combat abilities with +10 to weapon skills"
}
```

### Search & Filtering System

#### Search Categories
- **Constellations**: Search by constellation types (Warrior, Mage, Thief, Serpent, etc.)
- **Effect Types**: Filter by effect categories (Combat, Magic, Stealth, Utility)
- **Tags**: Filter by birthsign tags (Combat, Strength, Intelligence, etc.)

#### Filter Logic
```typescript
// Multi-layered filtering
1. Text Search: name, description, ability names using fuzzy search
2. Constellation Filter: Warrior/Mage/Thief/Serpent categorization
3. Tag Filter: Tag-based filtering with effect types and requirements
4. Display Controls: Show/hide specific content sections
```

2. **Secondary**: Accordion sections (Stats, Powers, Skills, Effects)
3. **Tertiary**: Detailed content within each section

### Icon System
- **Constellation Icons**: Color-coded by constellation type
  - ‚öîÔ∏è Warrior (red)
  - üîÆ Mage (blue)
  - üó°Ô∏è Thief (green)
  - üêç Serpent (purple)
  - ‚≠ê Other constellations (gold)

- **Section Icons**: Visual indicators for content types
  - üìä Stats section (blue) - Stat modifications
  - ‚ö° Powers section (yellow) - Special abilities
  - üéØ Skills section (green) - Skill bonuses
  - üîÆ Effects section (purple) - Conditional effects

- **Effect Icons**: Color-coded by effect type
  - ‚öîÔ∏è Combat abilities (red)
  - üîÆ Magic abilities (blue)
  - üó°Ô∏è Stealth abilities (green)
  - ‚ö° Utility abilities (purple)

### Responsive Design
- **Desktop**: 3-column grid with expandable accordions
- **Tablet**: 2-column grid with optimized accordion layout
- **Mobile**: Single column with full-width accordions

### Interaction Patterns
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle scaling and shadow changes
- **Selection States**: Ring borders and visual indicators
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens and spinners
- **Error States**: Clear messaging with retry options
- **Accordion Expansion**: Smooth animations and state persistence

- Filter and search functionality
- Custom hooks (useBirthsignData, useBirthsignFilters, useDisplayControls)
- Configuration functions (birthsignConfig)

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end birthsign selection flow
