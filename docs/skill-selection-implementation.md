# Skill Selection Implementation

## Overview

The skill selection feature has been implemented on the build page following the trait selection pattern. It provides separate areas for Major and Minor skills, each with their own autocomplete functionality and list items that can be cleared.

## Implementation Details

### Components Created

1. **SkillSelectionCard** (`src/features/skills/components/SkillSelectionCard.tsx`)
   - Main component that renders the skill selection interface
   - Follows the same pattern as `TraitSelectionCard`
   - Contains separate sections for Major and Minor skills
   - Each section has its own autocomplete and list of selected skills

2. **SkillAutocomplete** (`src/features/skills/components/SkillAutocomplete.tsx`)
   - Autocomplete component for skill selection
   - Follows the same pattern as `TraitAutocomplete`
   - Uses the `GenericAutocomplete` component
   - Displays skill information including category, description, and scaling

### Key Features

#### Layout
- **Double-wide card**: Spans the full width of the build page
- **Side-by-side layout**: Major skills on the left, Minor skills on the right
- **Responsive design**: Stacks vertically on smaller screens (`grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2`)

#### Major Skills Section (Left Side)
- **Limit**: 3 skills maximum
- **Visual Style**: Gold theme (`bg-yellow-50/50 border-yellow-500 shadow-yellow-500/20`)
- **Badge**: "Major" badge with gold styling (`bg-yellow-500 text-yellow-900`)
- **Counter**: Shows current selection (e.g., "1/3")

#### Minor Skills Section (Right Side)
- **Limit**: 6 skills maximum
- **Visual Style**: Silver theme (`bg-gray-100/50 border-gray-400 shadow-gray-400/20`)
- **Badge**: "Minor" badge with silver styling (`bg-gray-400 text-gray-900`)
- **Counter**: Shows current selection (e.g., "4/6")

#### Autocomplete Functionality
- **Position**: Autocomplete appears at the top of each section for easy access
- **Filtering**: Selected skills are filtered out from both autocomplete options
- **Global State**: Uses the global build object to track selections
- **Mutual Exclusion**: Skills can only be in one category (Major or Minor)
- **Placeholder Text**: Different placeholders for Major and Minor skill selection

#### Skill Display
- **Name**: Skill name prominently displayed
- **Category**: Badge showing skill category (Combat, Magic, etc.)
- **Description**: Formatted text description with line clamping
- **Remove Button**: X button to remove skills from selection

### Integration

#### Build Page Integration
- Added to `src/pages/BuildPage.tsx`
- Positioned as a double-wide card below the main grid layout
- Spans full width with Major skills on left, Minor skills on right
- Imported from `@/features/skills`

#### State Management
- Uses existing `useCharacterBuild` hook
- Leverages existing skill management functions:
  - `addMajorSkill(skillId)`
  - `addMinorSkill(skillId)`
  - `removeMajorSkill(skillId)`
  - `removeMinorSkill(skillId)`

#### Data Source
- Uses existing `useUnifiedSkills` hook
- Loads skills from `public/data/skills.json`
- Integrates with perk tree data for additional context

### Pattern Consistency

The implementation follows the established trait selection pattern:

1. **Card Structure**: Same layout and styling approach
2. **Autocomplete**: Reuses `GenericAutocomplete` component
3. **State Management**: Uses global build state
4. **Visual Design**: Consistent theming and badges
5. **Interaction**: Same remove button and selection flow

### Usage

Users can:
1. Select up to 3 Major skills using the autocomplete
2. Select up to 6 Minor skills using the autocomplete
3. Remove skills by clicking the X button
4. See skill categories and descriptions
5. Navigate to the full skills page for more details

The implementation ensures that:
- Skills can only be selected once (mutual exclusion)
- The interface is responsive and accessible
- The design is consistent with the existing trait selection
- The functionality integrates seamlessly with the build system
