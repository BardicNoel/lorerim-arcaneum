# Destiny Filters Implementation Log

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of destiny filters following the Race page pattern with autocomplete chips. The implementation follows the Model-View-Adapter (MVA) architecture.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Core Infrastructure
- [x] **useDestinyFilters Adapter** (`src/features/destiny/adapters/useDestinyFilters.ts`)
  - Build path filters (includes-node, ends-with-node)
  - Reference page filters (tags, prerequisites)
  - Smart node availability for build path filters
  - Filter state management (add, remove, clear)
  - Duplicate prevention
  - TypeScript type safety

- [x] **DestinyFilters Component** (`src/features/destiny/components/composition/DestinyFilters.tsx`)
  - Autocomplete search using CustomMultiAutocompleteSearch
  - Removable filter chips with Skyrim gold theme
  - Clear all functionality
  - Individual filter removal
  - Consistent styling with Race page

- [x] **Integration with UnifiedDestinyPage**
  - Tab-specific filters (Path Builder vs Reference)
  - Dynamic search categories based on available nodes
  - Proper state management for both filter types
  - Filter selection, removal, and clearing handlers

### 2. MVA Architecture Compliance
- [x] **Adapter Layer**: useDestinyFilters follows MVA pattern
- [x] **Composition Layer**: DestinyFilters component in composition directory
- [x] **Proper Exports**: Updated index files for clean imports
- [x] **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions

### 3. Testing & Quality Assurance
- [x] **Comprehensive Tests** (`src/features/destiny/adapters/__tests__/useDestinyFilters.test.tsx`)
  - 7 test cases covering all major functionality
  - Initialization, search categories, filter management
  - Add, remove, clear, duplicate prevention
  - All tests passing

- [x] **TypeScript Safety**
  - No type errors
  - Proper type definitions
  - Variable name conflict resolution

### 4. UI/UX Features
- [x] **Race Page Pattern**: Copied exact interaction pattern
- [x] **Visual Consistency**: Skyrim gold theme with hover states
- [x] **Autocomplete Chips**: Removable filter chips with clear labels
- [x] **Clear All Functionality**: Easy filter clearing
- [x] **Individual Removal**: Click chips to remove specific filters
- [x] **Duplicate Prevention**: Can't add the same filter twice

## 🔄 In Progress

### 1. Filter Logic Implementation
- [ ] **Path Filtering Logic**: The `filteredPaths` in useDestinyFilters currently returns empty array
- [ ] **Integration with Path Generation**: Connect filters to actual path generation
- [ ] **Reference Page Filtering**: Apply filters to the reference view items

## ❌ Remaining Tasks

### 1. Core Functionality
- [ ] **Implement Path Filtering**: 
  - Filter possible paths based on "includes-node" filters
  - Filter possible paths based on "ends-with-node" filters
  - Integrate with useDestinyPossiblePaths adapter

- [ ] **Reference Page Filtering**:
  - Apply tag filters to filter nodes in reference view
  - Apply prerequisite filters to filter nodes in reference view
  - Update DestinyAccordionList to use filtered data

- [ ] **Filter Persistence**:
  - Save filter state in URL or local storage
  - Restore filters on page reload
  - Share filtered views via URL

### 2. Advanced Features
- [ ] **Custom Search**: Implement fuzzy search for destiny filters
- [ ] **Filter Combinations**: Support multiple filter types simultaneously
- [ ] **Filter Validation**: Ensure filter combinations are valid
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Optimize filter calculations for large datasets

### 3. UI Enhancements
- [ ] **Filter Count Badges**: Show number of items matching each filter
- [ ] **Filter Suggestions**: Suggest related filters based on current selection
- [ ] **Filter History**: Remember recently used filters
- [ ] **Filter Export/Import**: Save and load filter configurations

### 4. Integration & Polish
- [ ] **Build Page Integration**: Connect destiny filters to the main build page
- [ ] **Character Build Sync**: Sync destiny filters with character build state
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Add proper error handling for filter operations
- [ ] **Loading States**: Add loading indicators for filter operations

### 5. Documentation & Testing
- [ ] **Component Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments to all components
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Test filter integration with path building
- [ ] **E2E Tests**: End-to-end tests for filter workflows
- [ ] **Performance Tests**: Test filter performance with large datasets

## 🎯 Next Priority Tasks

1. **Implement Path Filtering Logic** - Connect filters to actual path generation
2. **Reference Page Filtering** - Apply filters to the reference view
3. **Filter Persistence** - Save/restore filter state
4. **Build Page Integration** - Connect to main build page
5. **Performance Optimization** - Optimize for large datasets

## 📝 Notes

- The implementation follows the Race page pattern closely for consistency
- All core infrastructure is in place and working
- The main remaining work is connecting the filters to actual data filtering
- The MVA architecture makes it easy to extend and modify the filtering system
- TypeScript safety is maintained throughout the implementation
