# Build Page Skills Integration

## Overview

The build page now includes comprehensive skill and perk data display with interactive perk tree management. This enhancement allows users to view their selected skills with detailed perk information and interact with perk trees directly from the build page.

## Features

### 1. Enhanced Skill Display
- **Skill Level Badges**: Shows minimum level requirements based on selected perks
- **Perk Count Badges**: Displays selected perks vs total available perks
- **Visual Distinction**: 
  - Major skills (yellow theme)
  - Minor skills (gray theme) 
  - Other perked skills (blue theme)
  - Assigned skills without perks (orange theme)
- **Interactive Cards**: Clickable skill cards that open perk tree drawer
- **Organized View**: Skills organized by type with deduplication
- **Smart Autocomplete**: Add skills to "Other Perked Skills" section with autocomplete

### 2. Perk Tree Integration
- **Full Perk Tree Access**: Click any skill to open the complete perk tree drawer
- **Perk Selection**: Select/deselect perks with visual feedback
- **Perk Ranking**: Adjust perk ranks (for multi-rank perks)
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes immediately reflect in the build state

### 3. Skill Level Calculation
- **Automatic Calculation**: Minimum skill levels calculated based on perk requirements
- **Visual Indicators**: Level badges show required levels prominently
- **Dynamic Updates**: Levels update automatically when perks are changed

## Implementation Details

### Components

#### `BuildPageSkillCard`
- **Location**: `src/features/skills/components/view/BuildPageSkillCard.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Enhanced skill display component for build page
- **Features**:
  - Major/Minor skill selection with autocomplete
  - Skill cards with level and perk information
  - Click-to-open perk tree functionality
  - Remove skill functionality
  - Comprehensive skill categorization (perked, major, minor, assigned)
  - Visual distinction between different skill types

#### `SkillLevelBadge`
- **Location**: `src/features/skills/components/atomic/SkillLevelBadge.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Displays minimum skill level requirements
- **Features**:
  - Conditional rendering (only shows if level > 0)
  - Multiple size variants (sm, md, lg)
  - Blue theme to distinguish from other badges

### Data Flow

1. **Character Build Store**: Central state management for all build data
2. **Skill Data Adapters**: Transform raw skill data for different views
3. **Perk Data Management**: Handle perk selection and ranking
4. **Level Calculation**: Automatic calculation of minimum skill levels

### Key Hooks

- `useCharacterBuild`: Main build state management
- `useSkillsQuickSelector`: Skill selection for build page
- `usePerkData`: Perk tree data and interactions
- `useSkillData`: Raw skill data access

## Usage

### For Users
1. **Select Skills**: Use autocomplete to add major/minor skills
2. **Add Other Skills**: Use autocomplete in "Other Perked Skills" to add unassigned skills
3. **View Skill Info**: See level requirements and perk counts on skill cards
4. **Manage Perks**: Click any skill card to open perk tree
5. **Adjust Perks**: Select/deselect perks and adjust ranks
6. **Monitor Levels**: Watch skill level requirements update in real-time
7. **Smart Persistence**: Skills only appear in "Other Perked Skills" if they have perks selected

### For Developers
1. **Component Integration**: Replace `SkillSelectionCard` with `BuildPageSkillCard`
2. **State Management**: All state handled through existing character build system
3. **Data Consistency**: Perk changes automatically update skill levels
4. **UI Consistency**: Follows existing design patterns and theming

## Technical Architecture

### Model-View-Adapter Pattern
- **Model**: Character build store and skill/perk data
- **View**: BuildPageSkillCard and SkillPerkTreeDrawer
- **Adapter**: useSkillsQuickSelector and usePerkData

### State Management
- **Centralized**: All build data in character store
- **Reactive**: Changes propagate automatically
- **Persistent**: State persists across page navigation

### Component Hierarchy
```
BuildPage
└── BuildPageSkillCard
    ├── Major Skills Section (with autocomplete)
    ├── Minor Skills Section (with autocomplete)
    ├── Other Perked Skills Section
    ├── Assigned Skills Without Perks Section
    └── SkillPerkTreeDrawer
        └── PerkTreeCanvasII
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved UX**: Users can manage skills and perks in one place
2. **Better Information**: Clear display of level requirements and perk counts
3. **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing perk tree system
4. **Consistent Design**: Follows established UI patterns
5. **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate visual updates for all changes

## Recent Fixes

### Issue Resolution
1. **Perk Tree Not Opening**: Fixed skill ID mapping between skills data and perk trees data
2. **Limited Skill Display**: Enhanced to show all skills with perks, not just major/minor skills
3. **TypeScript Errors**: Resolved type mismatches in DetailSkill interface mapping

### Technical Improvements
- Added comprehensive skill categorization (major, minor, other perked, assigned)
- Improved visual distinction with color-coded themes
- Enhanced skill filtering logic with proper deduplication
- Fixed skill ID consistency across components
- Organized skills in logical order (major → minor → other perked → assigned)
- Added autocomplete for "Other Perked Skills" section
- Implemented smart persistence (skills only show if they have perks)
- Fixed type compatibility between UnifiedSkill and Skill interfaces

## Future Enhancements

1. **Skill Level Validation**: Warn users if they don't meet level requirements
2. **Perk Dependency Visualization**: Show perk prerequisites more clearly
3. **Build Optimization Suggestions**: Recommend perk selections based on build goals
4. **Export/Import**: Save and load perk configurations
5. **Comparison Tools**: Compare different perk builds side-by-side
