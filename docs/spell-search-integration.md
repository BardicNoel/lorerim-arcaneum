# Spell Search Integration

## Overview

This document describes the integration of spells into the global search system of the LoreRim Arcaneum application. The implementation follows the existing Model-View-Adapter (MVA) pattern and integrates seamlessly with the current search architecture.

## Current Status

✅ **COMPLETED**: Spell search integration has been fully implemented and tested. Spells are now appearing in the global search results and are properly integrated into the record type filters.

### What's Working
- ✅ Spell data loading and indexing in the search system
- ✅ Spell transformation to searchable items (923 spells indexed)
- ✅ Spell-specific search card component
- ✅ Component mapping for all view modes
- ✅ Spell-specific filtering (schools, levels)
- ✅ Record type filter integration ("Spell" button in Record Types section)
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage

## Implementation Details

### 1. Data Model Updates

#### SearchableItem Type Extension
- Added `'spell'` to the `SearchableItem.type` union type in `src/features/search/model/SearchModel.ts`
- Added spell-specific filter options: `spellSchools` and `spellLevels`

#### Spell Transformation
- Created `transformSpellsToSearchable()` function in `src/features/search/model/SearchUtilities.ts`
- Transforms `SpellWithComputed` objects into `SearchableItem` format
- Includes comprehensive searchable text covering:
  - Spell name, description, school, level
  - Effect names and descriptions
  - Spell properties (area, duration, instant)
  - Magicka cost, magnitude, duration, area values
  - Tags and metadata

### 2. Search Data Provider Integration

#### Spell Data Loading
- Updated `SearchDataProvider` to load spell data using `SpellDataProvider.getInstance()`
- Added spell transformation to the search index building process
- Integrated spell data validation in the store loading check

#### Spell-Specific Filtering
- Added filter logic for spell schools (`spellSchools`)
- Added filter logic for spell levels (`spellLevels`)
- Filters are applied based on the spell's school (category) and level properties

### 3. Component Integration

#### Spell Search Card
- Created `SpellSearchCard` component in `src/features/search/components/type-specific/SpellSearchCard.tsx`
- Wraps the existing `SpellAccordionCard` for search result display
- Handles selection state, click events, and compact mode
- Provides graceful fallback for missing spell data

#### Component Mapping
- Updated `componentMapping.tsx` to include spell component mapping
- Maps all view modes (card, accordion, grid, detail, compact) to `SpellSearchCard`

### 4. Hook Integration

#### useSearchData Hook
- Added spell data loading to `src/features/search/adapters/useSearchData.ts`
- Integrated spell indexing with the incremental indexing approach
- Added spell data to the ready state check

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the search page: `http://localhost:5173/search`
3. **Check Record Type Filters**: You should see a "Spell" button in the "Record Types" section with a count (e.g., "Spell (923)")
4. **Test Spell Filtering**: Click the "Spell" button to filter results to only show spells
5. **Test Spell Search**: Search for spell-related terms like:
   - `"fire"` - should find fire spells
   - `"heal"` - should find healing spells  
   - `"conjure"` - should find conjuration spells
   - `"destruction"` - should find destruction school spells
   - `"apprentice"` - should find apprentice level spells

### Automated Testing
Run the spell search tests:
```bash
npm test -- src/features/search/__tests__/SpellSearch.test.tsx
```

## Search Capabilities

### Searchable Content
- Spell names and descriptions
- Spell schools (Destruction, Conjuration, Restoration, etc.)
- Spell levels (Novice, Apprentice, Adept, Expert, Master)
- Effect names and descriptions
- Spell properties (area, duration, instant)
- Magicka cost, magnitude, duration, area values
- Tags and metadata

### Filter Options
- **Record Types**: "Spell" button in the Record Types section
- **Spell Schools**: Filter by magic school (Destruction, Conjuration, etc.)
- **Spell Levels**: Filter by spell level (Novice, Apprentice, etc.)
- **Type Filters**: Filter by spell type along with other content types

### Display Features
- Compact and full card views using existing `SpellAccordionCard`
- School badges and level indicators
- Effect descriptions and spell properties
- Direct navigation to spell pages via URL links

## Data Statistics

### Spell Distribution by School
- **Conjuration**: 220 spells
- **Destruction**: 210 spells
- **Alteration**: 179 spells
- **Restoration**: 158 spells
- **Illusion**: 150 spells
- **Unknown/None**: 6 spells
- **Total**: 923 spells

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. Consistent Integration
- Follows the existing MVA pattern used throughout the search system
- Leverages the "Simple Switchboard Pattern" for component rendering
- Maintains consistency with other searchable content types

### 2. Reusable Components
- Reuses existing `SpellAccordionCard` component
- Minimizes code duplication
- Maintains UI consistency across the application

### 3. Extensible Design
- Easy to add new spell-specific filters
- Simple to extend search capabilities
- Follows established patterns for future content types

### 4. Performance Optimized
- Uses incremental indexing approach
- Leverages existing Fuse.js search engine
- Efficient data transformation and caching

## Troubleshooting

### Spells Not Appearing in Search
If spells are not appearing in search results:

1. **Check Record Type Filters**: Look for a "Spell" button in the "Record Types" section
2. **Check Console Errors**: Open browser developer tools and check for any JavaScript errors
3. **Verify Data Loading**: Check if spell data is being loaded by looking at network requests
4. **Check Search Index**: Verify that the search index is being built with spell data
5. **Test Spell Data**: Verify that `public/data/player_spells.json` exists and contains data

### Spells Not Appearing in Record Type Filters
If spells are indexed but don't appear in the "Record Types" section:

1. **Check Timing**: The issue was caused by the `availableFilters` not being reactive to new data being indexed
2. **Verify Fix**: The fix adds `searchableItemsCount` as a dependency to the `availableFilters` useMemo in `useSearchFilters.ts`
3. **Refresh Page**: Try refreshing the search page to ensure the filters are recalculated
4. **Check Console**: Look for any errors in the browser console

### Common Issues
- **Spell data not loading**: Check if the spell data file is accessible
- **Search index not building**: Ensure all required stores are loaded before building the index
- **Component not rendering**: Verify that `SpellSearchCard` is properly mapped in `componentMapping.tsx`
- **Record type filter missing**: Ensure spells are being indexed and counted in `getAvailableFilters()`
- **Filters not updating**: The `useSearchFilters` hook now properly reacts to changes in indexed data

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Advanced Spell Filtering**: Add filters for spell effects, magicka cost ranges, etc.
2. **Spell Comparison**: Allow comparing multiple spells side by side
3. **Spell Recommendations**: Suggest related spells based on search history
4. **Spell Builds**: Allow creating and sharing spell combinations

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Character Builds**: Integrate spells into character build system
2. **Spell Learning**: Track which spells the character has learned
3. **Spell Progression**: Show spell progression paths and prerequisites
