# 🎨 Player Traits Catalog – Web Page Design Spec

## 📄 Purpose

The Player Traits page serves as a **read-only catalog** for players to browse and explore all available traits in Lorerim. It provides clear descriptions, effects, and optional items associated with each trait. There is no selection or unlock mechanic here—it’s purely informational.
