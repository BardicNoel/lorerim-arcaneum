# 📄 Spec: Add to Build & Pin Controls on Race Cards

## Overview

Each Race card in the `AccordionRacesPage` provides two independent actions:

- **Add to Build** – marks the race as the active selection for the user’s character build.
- **Pin as Reference** – toggles the race as pinned for quick access or comparison.

The two actions are **not mutually exclusive**. A race may be:  
✅ Pinned  
✅ Added to Build  
✅ Both pinned and added  
✅ Neither

## Controls

### 🎯 Add to Build Button

- **Type:** Primary button
- **Label:**
  - Default: `Add to Build`
  - Active: `In Build`
- **Visual State:**
  - Default: Neutral background (theme-aware)
  - Active: Gold-plated or Silver-plated button depending on current theme.
- **Behavior:**
  - Clicking replaces any previously added race in the build (only 1 race can be active in the build at a time).
  - If the current race is already in the build:
    - Button remains in `In Build` state
    - Clicking again has no effect (or optional “Remove from Build” toggle if desired).
- **Tooltip:**
  - `Add this race to your character build`
  - Active: `This race is currently in your build`

---

### 📌 Pin Toggle

- **Type:** Icon button (pin icon)
- **Visual State:**
  - Unpinned: Outline pin icon (neutral color)
  - Pinned: Filled pin icon with highlighted color (gold or silver per theme)
- **Behavior:**
  - Clicking toggles pinned state for the race.
  - Multiple races can be pinned simultaneously.
  - Pinned state persists locally in page state; extendable to global storage (Zustand) for cross-page persistence.
- **Tooltip:**
  - `Pin this race for quick reference`
  - Active: `Unpin this race`
